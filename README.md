# SingleLinkedListStack
I am just starting to learn JavaScript and figured a good way to familarize myself with the new language was to make something similar to what I have made in the past with C++ (language I have the most experience with)

This is just a modification of my code for a single linked list queue(which work on FIFO principle) so it works on LIFO principle.

My end goal is to implement a single linked list stack that takes user input to perform the following four functions:

1. push a value
2. pop a value
3. print the entire stack
4. search the stack for a specific value
5. close the program

This program is intended for personal education, and I plan on updating it as I learn more concepts in JavaScript

Along with this README file, this repository contains:
  1. a JavaScript file with the entire implementation of the sll stack (SingleLinkedListStack.js)
  2. an html file to run said JavaScript file (SingleLinkedListStack.html)(I plan to expand on this when I get the chance to learn more about html)
